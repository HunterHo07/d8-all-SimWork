# SimulEx Development Documentation

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture

#### Initial Setup
- Created project structure with separate directories for frontend, backend, and documentation
- Initialized Next.js 15.3.1 project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Set up PocketBase backend with initial collections and authentication

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with atomic design principles
- **Backend**: RESTful API with PocketBase for simplicity and rapid development
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state, React Query for server state
- **Animation Strategy**: GSAP for complex animations, Framer Motion for component transitions

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

#### Backend Development
- Created database schema with collections for users, scenarios, tasks, submissions, and analytics
- Implemented authentication flow with email/password and social login options
- Set up file storage for user submissions and assets
- Developed API endpoints for all CRUD operations

#### Frontend Development
- Designed and implemented core UI components with futuristic aesthetics
- Created responsive layout system with fluid typography and spacing
- Developed navigation system with animated transitions
- Implemented authentication UI and integration with backend

### Phase 3: Simulation Environment

#### Task Simulation Framework
- Developed modular system for different task types (coding, design, etc.)
- Created terminal emulation for developer tasks
- Implemented design submission and evaluation system
- Built decision-making interface for management scenarios

#### Analytics Engine
- Designed performance metrics calculation system
- Created visualization components for analytics dashboard
- Implemented session recording and playback functionality
- Developed personalized feedback generation

### Phase 4: Optimization and Polish

#### Performance Optimization
- Implemented code splitting and lazy loading for improved initial load time
- Optimized animations for performance across devices
- Added image optimization and responsive asset loading
- Conducted performance audits and addressed bottlenecks

#### User Experience Refinement
- Conducted usability testing and implemented feedback
- Refined animation timings and interaction patterns
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Polished visual design and consistency

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Complex Animation Performance
**Solution**: Implemented GPU-accelerated animations with GSAP, used requestAnimationFrame for custom animations, and optimized DOM manipulation.

### Challenge: Responsive Design with Advanced Layouts
**Solution**: Created custom fluid layout system using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and viewport-relative units with strategic breakpoints.

### Challenge: Real-time Data Synchronization
**Solution**: Implemented optimistic UI updates with React Query and efficient backend polling.

### Challenge: Terminal Emulation
**Solution**: Developed custom terminal component using xterm.js with secure execution sandboxing.
